# What the Tic Tac?

![xlimage](/assets/images/3/1.jpg)

During the fall of last year we started finding many tictac boxes, most of them full, scattered all across our property. We had probably found a dozen inexplicably placed tictac packages.  It’s a pretty strange find. Maybe the neighbour’s were throwing them around. I really hadn’t an explanation.

Almost a full year had passed and then again in the fall the mysterious tictacs started reappearing.  This time it kept getting stranger.  The placement in many cases was down right bizarre. One day I walked out my front door to find a package directly on top of the bush on the front patio.  They couldn’t land like this, it had to be purposefully placed. Someone had to be playing games, a bit disconcerting. Who would do something like this?  Finally some answers! I quickly ran to my newly installed zoneminder and ip camera setup. Finally an explanation had to be at hand…

Just some of the places where we had found the candy;

Precariously perched on the rail of my garden shed.

On top of the truck tire and on the garden path directly infront of the living room window.

In the strangest places… about a dozen of them.

How could they possibly manifest here?
Finally some answers!!!

The security system captured a squirrel placing the tictacs on top of the bush in front of my patio!  Later that week I found this guy on my neighbour’s lawn opening up a package and munching on the candy!

The neighbourhood squirrels have been running around our lawns with tictacs! Beyond the obvious and impressive dexterity required on their part to move the plastic packages this really creates more questions… Where are the squirrels getting their sweet treat? How did they learn to open the packs and get hooked on the candy? Is someone throwing out boxes and boxes of tictacs every fall or leaving them out for the squirrels????
